title: 'Modelling and Analysis of a Robotic Arm with Gripper Mechanism'
date: 'September 10, 2022'
excerpt: 'Fabricated an open-source robotic arm (MeArm v0.4) using a FDM 3D printer. Programmed the arm using NodeMCU ESP8266 WiFi SoC and developed a web app to control the arm from a web browser on any device. Also, conducted Forward Kinematic Analysis to compute the position of the end-effector for different joint angle configurations.'
