## What is JAMstack?

JAMstack stands for Javascript, APIs, and Markup which is an architectural approach that decouples the frontend from backend. The frontend is prebuilt from a data source and is deployed directly to a CDN (Content Delivery Network).

### Approach
#### Prebuilding the pages before deployment
The entire frontend is prebuilt into static pages and assets. The content for generating the web pages can be fetched from a database or a Content Managment System (CMS) like Wordpress, Contentful, Sanity, etc.

#### Dynamic content via APIs
The dynamic content on the web page can be fetched from backend using Javascript and APIs

## Benefits of JAMstack
JAMSTACK provides a number of benefits. These include- 
### High Performance
The page is generated ahead of time during the build and static prebuilt pages are served using a CDN. This eliminates the need to generate page view at every request.

### Maintainability
All the work is done during the build and a pre-generated site is served directly from a single host or directly from a CDN. This does not need a team of developers to keep the site running. And thus, reducing the maintenance.

### Portability
JAMSTACK sites are pre-generated which means they can be hosted on any platform. JAMSTACK websites can be hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), and a variety of hosting platforms.


## Intromech.com
[intromech.com](https://intromech.com/) is an Engineering and Technology blog. The website focuses on teaching complex engineering concepts in a simple and easy to understand method.

My main goal when building [intromech.com](https://intromech.com/) was to enhance the user experience with simple user interface and high performance and also to make it SEO friendly to rank high on Google search results.

There are a number of options for building a blog. One of the most famous platforms that most bloggers use is [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/). Wordpress features a lot of themes/templates for creating a blog. But the problem with Wordpress is building a custom website requires a lot of code and I just wanted to build something simple and focus more on creating content. Also, improving the performance of Wordpress sites is a hassle. So, I decided to go with the JAMSTACK approach of building website.
