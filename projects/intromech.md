In 2020, when I was in the second year of my BE Mechanical Engineer program I decided to start a blog on Mechanical Engineering. At that time there were not many resources on the internet for mechanical engineers. So, I started [intromech.com](https://intromech.com/), a platform where I explain complex engineering concepts in simple and easy to understand ways using animations, infographics, images, etc.

I created the [intromech.com](https://intromech.com/) website by myself with my knowledge of web development. My main goal was to build a simple user interface, without any distractions so that people can focus more on reading the content instead of getting distracted by the UI. Also I wanted to build a website which is highly accessible, and should have good SEO, and high performance.

So, I decided to use the [JAMStack](https://www.netlify.com/jamstack/) approach of building websites. JAM in JAMstack stands for Javascript, API, Markup. JAMstack is a modern software architecture and philosophy that allows us to create static assets from an API (in my case from a Content Management System (CMS) ) and then serve those pre-rendered static assets to the users. The static assets can then be deployed to a Content Delivery Network (CDN) which helps in fast delivery of the site to users.



I decided to use [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), a static site generator to create the website. Because Eleventy is very fast and simple and helps in developing the website fast. I used [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/) as a CMS because Sanity allows many customization options and it's very easy to deploy on the sanity studio. I deployed the website on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) which is a great Content Delivery Network.

## Perfect Lighthouse Scores

The website is 100% optimised for accessibility and 100% optimized for SEO. The performance of the website is also good and the pages load very fast. I’m using responsive images, lazy loading to increase the performance of the website.
