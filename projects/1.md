# What is JAMstack?

JAMstack stands for Javascript, APIs, and Markup that decouples the frontend from backend.The frontend can then be deployed directly to a CDN (Content Delivery Network).

## Approach
### Prebuilding the pages before deployment
The entire frontend is prebuilt into static pages and assets. The content for generating the web pages can be fetched from a database or a Content Managment System (CMS) like Wordpress, Contentful, Sanity, etc.

### Dynamic content via APIs
The dynamic content on the web page can be fetched from backend using Javascript and APIs
